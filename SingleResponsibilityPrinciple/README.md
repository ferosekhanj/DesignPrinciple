# Milkman

We would like to help our milkman in delivery.

# Features

## Step 1
- Each house in the street provides the number of milk packs needed.
- Our Milkman in the morning delivers the order to each house.

## Step 2
- We are delivering 3 different type of milk
- Cow, Goat & Soya
- House can choose the milk type
  
## Step 3
- A house can order a combination of milk daily.

## Step 4
- we added a new milk variety camel milk
- we are discontinuing the vegan milk
- we are expanding our business and would like to deliver Choclates and Biscut orders with the milk

## Step 5
- We are switching to a prepaid model, before delivery, the milk man checks whether there is enough money available in the customer wallet. If balance is less then no delivery is made. 

## Step 6
- We are going to allow the customer to order custom quantity of milk (500ml,1000ml,200ml)
- We would like to deliver the order if half of the cost is available in the wallet and mark the remaining as debt (as a good gesture)


- [Developer]Wait, we need some time to speed up
